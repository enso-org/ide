A simple http server that takes POST requests for path "/" on localhost and
writes their body to a new file in the "log" subdirectory of the current working
directory

To start the server, make sure that all necessary packages are installed
(through Lerna) and call `npm run start`. To learn more about the options and
their default values, use the `--help` option.
