//! White point is the reference white or target white as seen by a standard observer under a
//! standard illuminant. For example, photographs taken indoors may be lit by incandescent lights,
//! which are relatively orange compared to daylight. Defining "white" as daylight will give
//! unacceptable results when attempting to color-correct a photograph taken with incandescent
//! lighting.
//!
//! Note that this module implements currently only `D65` white point. In case other will be needed
//! they can be easily ported from the Rust `Palette` library implementation.
