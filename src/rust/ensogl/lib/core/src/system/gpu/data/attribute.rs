shared! { AttributeScope
/// [`AttributeScope`] is a set of named [`Buffer`]s of the same length. The buffers con contain any
/// WebGL specific information, like geometry information. The buffers are named for easy access.
/// For example, the current geometry implementation uses [`AttributeScope`] to define logical
/// attribute scopes named "point" and "instance". They contain information attached to points and
/// geometry instances respectively. Also, the "point" [`AttributeScope`] can contain such buffers
/// as "color", while "instance" [`AttributeScope`] can be created with a "position" buffer to allow
/// controlling placement of each instance separately.
///
///
/// # Internal Design (Memory management and ID re-use)
/// TODO: The proper memory management should be implemented. Currently, after creating a lot of
///       instances and dropping them, the memory is not freed. This section explains why and
///       describes possible solutions.
///
/// Currently, the `free_ids` field keeps track of all instance indexes that are not used anymore.
/// It is stored in a sorted container in order to preserve the display order when creating new
/// instances (new instances appear on top of older instances if no dropping happened in the
/// meantime). Alternative sorting solutions are described in the docs for the [`Symbol`].
///
/// In order to properly re-use memory, we need to free it sometimes. The following solutions are
/// possible:
///
/// 1. Keeping track of all free indexes in a sorted container (like [`BTreeSet`] or the specialized
///    [`enso_data::Diet`] and in case the biggest index is freed, iterating over the indexes and
///    freeing as much as possible. This solution has the downside that the indexes are stored in
///    order, so insertion and deletion is much slower than when using unordered [`Vec`]. Also, this
///    does not work well if a instance with a big ID is kept alive, as it will prevent memory of
///    all instances with smaller IDs from being cleaned. See benchmarks in the `enso_data::diet`
///    module to learn more.
///
/// 2. Keeping track of all free indexes in an unordered container and in case the biggest index is
///    freed, sorting the container and freeing the memory. As an optimization, the sorting might
///    be performed after the frame (or several frames) was drawn. It's not obvious when this
///    solution will be slower / faster than the solution (1), but time differences may be big.
///    See benchmarks in the `enso_data::diet` module to learn more.
///
/// 3. Keeping track of all free indexes and in case a lot of them are free, re-ordering the
///    instances and freeing the memory. This would require all instance-users (like [`Sprite`]s) to
///    keep instance IDs in some kind of `Rc<Cell<ID>>`, which may slow attrib read/write down.
///    However, this solution works well even if an instance with a big ID is kept alive. It's not
///    obvious when this solution will be slower / faster than other ones, but time differences may
///    be big. See benchmarks in the `enso_data::diet` module to learn more.
///
/// To learn more about these mechanisms and connected design decisions, read the docs of
/// [`Symbol`], especially the "Changing attribute & GPU memory consumption" sections.
