/// Symbol is a surface with attached `Shader`.

/// # Depth-sorting, memory cleaning, and indexes re-using.
/// There are several possible implementation architectures for attribute management. The currently
/// used architecture may not be the best one, but the choice is not obvious and would require
/// complex benchmarking. However, lets compare the available architectures and lets list their
/// good and bad sides:
///
///
/// ### A. Drawing instanced geometry (the current architecture).
///
/// 1. Rendering.
///    Very fast. May not be as fast as some of other methods, but that may not be the case with
///    modern hardware, see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/65376034/889902, and also
///    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62537968/using-opengl-instancing-for-rendering-2d-scene-with-object-depths-and-alpha-blen#answer-62538277
///
/// 1. Changing attribute & GPU memory consumption.
///    Very fast and with low memory consumption. Requires only 1 WebGL call (attribute per
///    instance).
///
/// 2. Sorting of instances.
///    Complex. Requires sorting of all attribute buffers connected with a particular instance. For
///    big buffers (many instances) it may require significant CPU -> GPU data upload. For example,
///    taking the last element to the front, would require shifting all attributes in all buffers,
///    which basically would mean uploading all data to the GPU from scratch for that particular
///    geometry. Also, this would require keeping instance IDs in some kind of `Rc<Cell<usize>>`,
///    as during sorting, the instance IDs will change, so all sprites would need to be updated.
///
///
/// ### B. Drawing non-instanced, indexed geometry.
///
/// 1. Rendering.
///    Very fast. May be faster than architecture (A). See it's description to learn more.
///
/// 1. Changing attribute & GPU memory consumption.
///    4 times slower and 4 times more memory hungry than architecture (A). Requires setting each
///    attribute for each vertex (4 WebGL calls). During drawing, vertexes are re-used by using
///    indexed geometry rendering.
///
/// 2. Sorting of instances.
///    The same issues as in architecture (A). Even more CPU -> GPU heavy, as the attribute count
///    is bigger.
///
///
/// ### C. Drawing non-instanced, non-indexed geometry. Using indexing for sorting.
///
/// 1. Rendering.
///    Very fast. May be faster than architecture (A). See it's description to learn more.
///
/// 1. Changing attribute & GPU memory consumption.
///    6 times slower and 6 times more memory hungry than architecture (A). Requires setting each
///    attribute for each vertex (6 WebGL calls). During drawing, vertexes are not re-used, and thus
///    we need to set attributes for each vertex of each triangle.
///
/// 2. Sorting of instances.
///    Simple. We can re-use index buffer to sort the geometry by telling GPU in what order it
///    should render each of the vertexes. Unlike previous architectures, this would not require to
///    create any more internally mutable state regarding attribute index management (the indexes
///    will not change during sorting).
///
///    However, sorting for the needs of memory compression (removing unused memory for sparse
///    attrib arrays) would still require re-uploading sorted data to GPU, just as in architecture
///    (A).
///
///
/// ### D. Keeping all attribute values in a texture and passing index buffer to the shader.
///
/// This is a very different architecture to what is currently implemented and might require very
/// complex refactoring in order to be even tested and benchmarked properly. To learn more about the
/// idea, follow the link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/65376034/889902.
///
/// 1. Rendering.
///    Fast. May be slower than architecture (A). Needs real benchmarks.
///
/// 1. Changing attribute & GPU memory consumption.
///    Changing attribute would require 2 WebGL calls: the `bindTexture`, and `texParameterf` (or
///    similar). Performance of this solution is questionable, but in real life, it may be as fast
///    as architecture (A). The memory consumption should be fine as well, as WebGL textures behave
///    like C++ Vectors, so even if we allocate the texture of max size, it will occupy only the
///    needed space. This will also limit the number of instances on the stage, but the limit will
///    be big enough (assuming max texture od 2048px x 2048px and 20 float attributes per shader,
///    this will allow us to render over 200 000 shapes). Also, this architecture would allow us to
///    pass more attributes to shaders than it is currently possible, which on the other hand,
///    would probably negatively affect the fragment shader performance.
///
/// 2. Sorting of instances.
///    Simple. Next to the attribute texture, we can pass index buffer to the shader, which will
///    dictate what initial offset in the texture should be used. This would allow for the fastest
///    sorting mechanism of all of the above architectures.
///
///    However, sorting for the needs of memory compression (removing unused memory for sparse
///    attrib arrays) would still require re-uploading sorted data to GPU, just as in architecture
///    (A).
///
///
/// ### E. Using the depth-buffer for sorting.
///
/// As with architecture (C), this is a very different architecture to what is currently
/// implemented and might require very complex refactoring in order to be even tested and
/// benchmarked properly. This architecture, however, is the most common architecture among all
/// WebGL / OpenGL applications, but it is not really well suitable for SDF-based shapes rendering,
/// as it requires anti-aliasing to be done by multisampling, which is not needed with SDF-based
/// rasterization. It lowers the quality and drastically increases the rendering time (in the case
/// of 4x4 multisampling, the rendering time is 16x bigger than the time of architecture (A)).
///
/// There is one additional thread to consider here, namely, with some browsers, systems, and GPU
/// combinations, the super-sampling anti-aliasing is not accessible in WebGL. In such situations we
/// could use a post-processing anti-aliasing techniques, such as [FXAA][1] or [SMAA][2], however,
/// the resulting image quality will be even worse. We could also use custom multi-sampled render
/// buffers for implementing [multi-sampled depth buffers][3].
/// [1] https://github.com/mitsuhiko/webgl-meincraft/blob/master/assets/shaders/fxaa.glsl
/// [2] http://www.iryoku.com/papers/SMAA-Enhanced-Subpixel-Morphological-Antialiasing.pdf
/// [3] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50613696/whats-the-purpose-of-multisample-renderbuffers
///
/// 1. Rendering.
///    May be 9x - 16x slower than architecture (A), depending on multi-sampling level. Also, the
///    final image quality and edge sharpness will be lower. There is, however, an open question,
///    whether there is an SDF-suitable depth-buffer sorting technique which would not cause such
///    downsides (maybe involving SDF-based depth buffer). Currently, we don't know of any such
///    technique.
///
/// 1. Changing attribute & GPU memory consumption.
///    Fast with low memory consumption. The same as with architecture (A), (B), or (C).
///
/// 2. Sorting of instances.
///    Simple and fast. Much faster than any other architecture listed before, as it does not
///    require upfront CPU-side buffer sorting.
///
///
/// ### F. Using depth-peeling / dual depth-peeling algorithms.
///
/// As with architecture (C), this is a very different architecture to what is currently
/// implemented and might require very complex refactoring in order to be even tested and
/// benchmarked properly. The idea is to render the scene multiple times, as long as some objects
/// do overlap, by "peeling" the top-most (and bottom-most) layers every time. See the
/// [Interactive Order-Independent Transparency][1], the
/// [Order Independent Transparency with Dual Depth Peeling][2], and the
/// [sample WebGL implementation][3] to learn more.
///
/// [1] https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs5610/handouts/order_independent_transparency.pdf
/// [2] http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.193.3485&rep=rep1&type=pdf
/// [3] https://medium.com/@shrekshao_71662/dual-depth-peeling-implementation-in-webgl-11baa061ba4b
///
/// 1. Rendering.
///    May be several times slower than architecture (A) due to the need to render the scene by
///    peeling components. However, in contrast to the architecture (D), the final image quality
///    should be as good as with architecture (A), (B), or (C).
///
/// 1. Changing attribute & GPU memory consumption.
///    Fast with low memory consumption. The same as with architecture (A), (B), or (C).
///
/// 2. Sorting of instances.
///    Simple and fast. As fast as architecture (E), as it does not require upfront CPU-side buffer
///    sorting.
