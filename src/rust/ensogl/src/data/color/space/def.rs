    /// You should be aware that the `CIE L*C*h°` is much wider than sRGB space which most monitors

    /// ## Parameters
    ///
    /// - `lightness` [0.0 - 1.0]
    ///   Lightness of 0.0 gives absolute black and 100.0 gives the brightest white. Most
    ///   implementations use value range of [0 .. 100] instead. It was rescaled for convenience.
    ///
    /// - `chroma` [0.0 - 1.0]
    ///   The colorfulness of the color. It's similar to saturation. 0.0 gives gray scale colors,
    ///   and numbers around 128-181 gives fully saturated colors. The upper limit should include
    ///   the whole L*a*b* space and some more. You can use higher values than 1.0 to target `P3`,
    ///   `Rec.2020`, or even larger color spaces. Most implementations use value range of
    ///   [0 .. 132] instead. It was rescaled for convenience.
    ///
    /// - `hue` [0.0 - 1.0]
    ///   The hue of the color. Decides if it's red, blue, purple, etc. You can use `hue_degrees`
    ///   or `hue_radians` to gen hue in non-normalized form. Most implementations use value range
