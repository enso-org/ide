/// Write the provided text to the clipboard. Please note that:
/// - It uses the [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API)
///   under the hood.
/// - This is an asynchronous function. The results will not appear in the clipboard immediately.
///   The delay may be caused for example by waiting for permission from the user.
/// - This will probably display a permission prompt to the user for the first time it is used.
/// - The website has to be served over HTTPS for this function to work correctly.
/// - This function needs to be called from within user-initiated event callbacks, like mouse or
///   key press. Otherwise it will not work.
///
/// Moreover, in case something fails, this function implements a fallback mechanism which tries
/// to create a hidden text field, fill it with the text and use the obsolete
/// [Document.execCommand](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand)
/// function.

///
/// Moreover, this function works in a very strange way in Firefox.
/// [Firefox only supports reading the clipboard in browser extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/readText).
/// In such case this function fallbacks to the `paste` event. Whenever it is triggered, it
/// remembers its value and passes it to the callback. This means, that in Firefox this function
/// will work correctly only when called as a direct action to the `cmd + v` shortcut.
