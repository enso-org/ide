// =============

/// This trait represents a type of event that may fire from some specific JS `EventTarget`.
///
/// For example, `WebSocket.close` is such an event, where `close` is event type and `WebSocket` is
/// the `EventTarget`.
///
/// The purpose is to increase type safety by grouping event type name, event target type and event
/// value type together.
///
/// Typically this trait is to be implemented for uncreatable types, created for the sole
/// purpose of denoting a particular event type within a context of an event target.

    /// to the listener.
