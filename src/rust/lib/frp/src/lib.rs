//! # Introduction
//!
//! **READ THIS PAGE CAREFULLY.**
//!
//! This module implements a sophisticated event handling framework, known as Functional Reactive
//! Programming system. It allows creating data flow diagrams from predefined nodes. Over years many
//! different FRP implementations appeared, especially in the Haskell community. The implementations
//! differ both in concepts they use, as well as the provided functionality. The following
//! implementation focuses on providing high performance and maintainability (ability to reason
//! about correctness of complex data flow graphs).
//!
//! In order to grasp some of the main ideas we strongly encourage you to read the following FRP
//! introduction. Although this implementation differs in few details, understanding these concepts
//! would be helpful: https://github.com/hansroland/reflex-dom-inbits/blob/master/tutorial.md
//!
//!
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The FRP system exposed by this library can be used in two modes - network and dynamic. The
//! former was designed as a highly maintainable framework and it is what you should choose almost
//! always. The API was designed mainly with this use case in mind. In order to use the network
//! mode, just use the API exposed by `Network` and all node types without "Owned" prefix. In order
//! to use dynamic mode, do not use `Network` and use nodes with the "Owned" prefix. The modes can
//! be mixed, but unless you really know what you are doing, you are advised not to do it.
//!
//!
//! ## Network mode
//! In this mode you define immutable FRP graphs called `Network`s. You are not allowed to add or
//! remove nodes from `Network` after it was defined. You are, however, allowed to create, remove,
//! connect, and reconnect networks dynamically. The `Network` manages the lifetime of all of
//! its nodes, and you are always working on weak references to the nodes. You can also define a
//! `BridgeNetwork` between two or more `Network`s which will be responsible for converting or
//! tagging data. The lifetime of `BridgeNetwork` is always managed by lifetimes of the `Network`s
//! it is connected to. It is dropped as soon as any of the networks gets dropped.
//!
//! An example use case is a slider and scene definition. The slider component can contain its own
//! internal FRP network which manages its state and mouse interactions. The scene FRP network can
//! connect to slider network whenever a new slider is created. In order to tag the value change
//! events with information which slider they originate from, a `BridgeNetwork` should be used.
//!
//!
//! ## Dynamic mode.
//! Please note, that although there are valid use cases when this mode is useful, you should always
//! default to network mode instead. In this mode the `Network` is not used and you are using strong
//! references to nodes instead (types prefixed with "Owned" in the API, like `frp::OwnedSource`).
//! Nodes are dropped as soon as no references exist to them anymore.
//!
//!
//!
//! # FRP graph architecture
//!
//! The architecture of the FRP engine is pretty complex and it is hard to understand all the
//! dependencies by reading the code only. In order to make it easier, the following diagram was
//! prepared. It visualizes a simple FRP network of `source -> count -> map(|t| t.to_string())`.
//! You can view the diagram in any GraphViz tool, for example this one:
//! https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline
//!
//! Meaning of the graph elements:
//! - On the left there are two `Network` nodes which will be missing if used in dynamic mode.
//! - Colors indicate to which network nodes belong (nodes of that color will be dropped as
//!   soon as the network gets dropped). Nodes with double color will be dropped as soon as an event
//!   will be emitted to nodes belonging to the dropped network.
//! - Black solid edges without arrows are just fields inside structure.
//! - Black solid edges with arrows are `Rc` pointers.
//! - Black dashed edges with arrows are `Weak` pointers.
//! - Red solid edges with arrows are trait object interfaces.
//! - The gray arrows are possible connections depending on which mode was used. In case of network
//!   mode, either an edge to `Stream` or a node without the "Owned" prefix will be created
//!   (depending on what will be provided to node constructor). In dynamic mode, as you will be
//!   providing strong node references to their constructors, the arrow to the node with "Owned"
//!   prefix will be created.
