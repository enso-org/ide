//! The Models.
//!
//! Models in this crate are structure which represents the logical "objects" being a part of the
//! project, like project itself, module, execution context etc. They usually reflects the entities
//! managed by LanguageServer.
//!
//! For Each model there is defined:
//! * An API trait
//! * A Synchronized Model implementing the API, which try to notify Language Server about all
//!   changes in the modeled entity.
//! * Sometimes a Plain Model, which stores data but does not synchronize anything.
//! * Sometimes a Mock generated with `mock-all` crate.
//! * A Shared Handle, which hides some of above API implementors under `Rc<dyn API>`.
//!
//! Plain Model and Mock should be used in tests only, which simplifies mocking dependencies. In
//! the actual code the Synchronized Model should be used. Each struct using model as a dependency
//! should use the Shared Handle.
//!
//! As the models are usually shared between many controllers, they should implement "internal
//! mutability" pattern.
