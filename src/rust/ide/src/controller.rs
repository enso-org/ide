//! This module contains all the controllers. They cover everything that is
//! between clients of remote services (like language server and file manager)
//! and views.
//!
//! The API of each controller is "view-facing", in contrast to the models in [`crate::model`] which
//! are focusing on reflecting the Engine entities (thus can be called "Engine-facing").
