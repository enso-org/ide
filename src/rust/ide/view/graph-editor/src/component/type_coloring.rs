// ================================
// === Type to Color Conversion ===
// ================================

/// Return the color that corresponds to the given type. Can be used to color edges and ports.
///
/// ## Overview
/// Currently, this is a very simple mechanism, which infers color based on the input type name.
/// There are many ways we can improve it in the future, but it will also require Engine to develop
/// better type inference mechanisms. For example, currently we do not get information about
/// parametric types, so we don't know whether something is a `Vector Number`, `Vector String`, or
/// something else. It is just `Vector` and it is equivalent to `Vector Any`.
///
/// ## Theme Defined Colors
/// Please note that this function queries the currently selected theme for special colors. Themes
/// can define color overrides, like `code::types::String::hue = 0.3` to override the selected
/// color hue.
///
/// ## Future Development
/// There are few important ideas regarding future development of this mechanism. First of all,
/// user defining a new type should be able to mark it as a "container" type and point which of
/// parameters should be used to obtain the color. So for example, user defining the type
/// `Vector a` should be able to describe it as a "container", and point `a` as the type of its
/// items. This way, `Vector Number` should be colored in similar way to `Number` (maybe with some
/// additional "container edge style", like dashed lines). If user do not provide such
/// parametrization, other mechanisms should be used. For example, `Point Float` and `Point Number`
/// should have similar colors, completely distinct from their parameter types.
