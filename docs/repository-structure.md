# Repository Structure Overview

* `build` - Helper JS scripts used by `run` script in the main directory.  
* `docs` - Documentation.
* `src/js` - the JS part of IDE application.
* `src/rust` - All Rust crates.

## Crates

The crates structure is currently in process of refactoring, and there are still places where
code does not fit the crate it is placed. The work is tracked in #448 epic.

The detailed description of each crate is placed in its documentation at top of its `lib.rs` file.

There are two main parts of our codebase: **EnsoGL library** and the **Enso IDE application**. The
crates used in common by those parts are put in `src/rust/lib`, and should be documented at the
top of their `lib.rs` file.  

Other crates usually contains code shared by those two. The one noteworthy is the **prelude** crate
(`src/rust/prelude`) which gathers the commonly used imports across all crates in our repository.

### EnsoGL (`src/rust/ensogl`)

EnsoGL is a library providing fast 2D vector rendering engine with a rich set of
primitives and high-level GUI components. Its structure will be described after the planned
 refactoring in #598.


### Enso IDE (`src/rust/ide`) 

The Enso IDE crate contains entry point function of application, and integrates two main parts
of it:
* IDE View (`src/rust/ide/lib/view`) - The visual part of IDE. It contains no logic and
  connections to backend - instead it delivers FRP endpoints to be integrated with controllers. That
  design allow us to measure of vis-part only performance. 
* IDE Controllers (`src/rust/ide/lib/controller`) - The logic part of IDE, that is 
  synchronizing graph a text and communication with Engine. It should not
  know anything about visual part. In the future we may consider creating some sort of CLI for
  automatic integration tests.
