Enso is an award-winning interactive programming language with dual visual and
textual representations. It is a tool that spans the entire stack, going from
high-level visualisation and communication to the nitty-gritty of backend
services, all in a single language. Watch the following introduction video to
learn what Enso is, and how it helps companies build data workflows in minutes
instead of weeks.

This repository contains the source code of Enso interface only. If you are
interested in how the interface is build or you want to develop it with us, you
are in the right place. See the
[development and contributing guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more
about the code structure and the development process.
