/// For `struct Foo<T>` or `enum Foo<T>` provides:
/// * `IntoIterator` implementations for `&'t Foo<T>`, `iter` and `into_iter`
/// methods.
///
/// The iterators will:
/// * for structs: go over each field that declared type is same as the
///   struct's last type parameter.
/// * enums: delegate to current constructor's nested value's iterator.
///
/// Enums are required to use only a single element tuple-like variant. This
/// limitation should be lifted in the future.
///
/// Any dependent type stored in struct, tuple or wrapped in enum should have
/// dependency only in its last type parameter. All dependent types that are not
/// tuples nor directly the yielded type, are required to provide `iter` method
/// that returns a compatible iterator (possible also derived).
///
/// Caller must have the following features enabled:
/// ```
/// #![feature(generators)]
/// #![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)]
/// ```
///
/// When used on type that takes no type parameters, like `struct Foo`, does
/// nothing but yields no errors.
